## Description

Push_swap is a sorting project where you must order numbers using two stacks and a limited set of operations, aiming to minimize the number of moves.
Efficiency matters because the program is graded by how few operations it produces, not by execution time.


## Instructions

1. The program takes a list of integers as arguments.
2. All numbers must be valid integers, **no duplicates are allowed**, and **values must not exceed `INT_MAX` / `INT_MIN`**.
3. The goal is to sort the numbers in **ascending order** in **Stack A**.
4. You are only allowed to use the predefined **push_swap operations**.
5. The program outputs the list of operations to **standard output**.
6. If the input is already sorted, the program prints nothing.
7. In case of invalid input, the program must print `Error\n` to **standard error** and exit.

### Use of AI

AI tools (ChatGPT) were used **as an assistant**, not as a code generator.

Specifically, AI was used to:
- Clarify **algorithmic concepts** (Big-O notation, worst-case complexity)
- Help **explain and document** the chunks algorithm
- Review logic and suggest **optimizations and refactoring ideas**
